I am in the last semester of my master's, and things are intense. I have three classes:

    1. STA631 Statistical Modeling and Regression
    2. STA616 Statistical Programming
    3. CIS678 Machine Learning

In addition, I am doing an internship and searching for my first job in the middle of a massive tech layoff and hiring freeze in most companies. It feels like running a last lap of a long-distance race, and I'm questioning if I'll be able to make it.
